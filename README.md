# NFT Marketplace

## Overview

This project is a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace that allows users to create and sell their NFTs. The marketplace is built using Solidity with OpenZeppelin for smart contract development, Hardhat for testing and deployment, IPFS for decentralized image storage, and React for the frontend.

## Features

- **NFT Creation:** Users can easily create their own NFTs, specifying metadata and uploading images stored securely on IPFS.
- **Marketplace:** A decentralized marketplace where users can list their NFTs for sale and potential buyers can discover and purchase them.
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity smart contracts, utilizing OpenZeppelin for secure and standardized contract development.
- **User Interface:** A React-based frontend providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for interacting with the NFT marketplace.
